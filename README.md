# JRequioma eLearning
eLearning platform created with Vue 3, [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/), and [mswjs/data](https://github.com/mswjs/data)

## Dummy Accounts

Email | Password | Role
--- | --- | ---
johndoe@test.com | pass | admin
jamessmith@test.com | pass | instructor
adamsilver@test.com | pass | student
